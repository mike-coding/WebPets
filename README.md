# WEBPETS v0.0.3 ALPHA

This is intended to be a continuation of bitbeast arena, reimagined as a MOBILE in-browser virtual pet game. I'm not sure where exactly this thing will end up. A little bit of neopets, a lot of tamagotchi, some digimon. 

We're very much in the early stages here still, but I'm stoked about the accessibility of web dev.
