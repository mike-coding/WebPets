# WEBPETS v0.0.3 ALPHA

This is intended to be a continuation of bitbeast arena, reimagined as a MOBILE in-browser virtual pet game. I'm not sure where exactly this thing will end up. A little bit of neopets, a lot of tamagotchi, some digimon. 

We're very much in the early stages here still, but I'm stoked about the accessibility of web dev.

## TO-DO
* [x] Egg hatching & animation
* [ ] Bug Fixes
    * [x] Name update bug
    * [ ] Element size responsiveness on various devices
* [x] Happiness, hunger degradation
* [ ] Feeding
* [ ] Pet metabolism (pooping!!!)
    * [x] Simple pooping
    * [x] Persistent poops
    * [ ] Poops tied to hunger bar
    * [ ] Populate poops that would have been made since last login
    * [ ] Lots of poops start to degrade happiness faster (or can cause illness?)
    * [ ] Variable metabolism by life stage
* [ ] Away time simulations 
    * [ ] e.g. if a lot of poops while gone, also simulate odds of pet sickness, or happiness decrease more quickly
* [ ] Pet health / illness
* [ ] Items, inventory
    * [ ] shop
    * [ ] item definitions
* [ ] minigames
    * [x] minigame 1 (endless runner)
* [ ] sprite revisions
    * [x] 1-1
    * [ ] 1-2
* [ ] Summary page battle tab
* [ ] Do we really need to be tracking minigame state outside of the minigame itself
    * [ ] My guess is no. Move this logic inside the game component
